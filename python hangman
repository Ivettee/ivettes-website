my first html website made at girls who code



def intro():
    answer = input("Hello, welcome to 'hangman'! What is your name?")
print = ("answer" + "To begin to play start guessing the word by typing a letter. The world contains 5 dijits"")
def main ()
    def comments(choice):
    if choice==""
    print("")
    else:
        print("You have to pick a letter")
print("Hello, World!")
